## Authentication & API

The frontend includes a robust API layer (`Api.jsx`) that handles:
- **CSRF Protection:** Automatically extracts and attaches CSRF tokens from cookies for state-changing requests.
- **JWT Handling:** Token-based authentication with automatic refresh logic for expired access tokens.
- **Protected Routes:** Specialized components (`ProtectedRoute` and `AdminProtectedRoute`) to restrict access based on user roles.
